Splunk SwiftOnSecurity Configuration: Enhanced Detection via Tuned Sysmon Telemetry
This project demonstrates how to upgrade Windows host visibility using Sysmon with the SwiftOnSecurity configuration, then validate detection of obfuscated PowerShell execution via local logs and Splunk SIEM. It builds directly on the Cybersecurity Battlefield framework by enhancing the Process Execution and Event Monitoring layers at the host level, while strengthening telemetry flow to the SIEM.

üéØ Objective
To replicate a common adversary technique ‚Äî obfuscated PowerShell execution ‚Äî and confirm that a professionally tuned Sysmon configuration provides high-fidelity telemetry from the endpoint to Splunk.

üîß Battlefield Alignment
Layer	Purpose
Process Execution	Capture granular process creation and command-line arguments.
Event Monitoring	Improve detection fidelity with structured Sysmon logging.
SIEM Ingestion Layer	Route meaningful telemetry to Splunk and confirm indexing.

This tuning strategy reflects real-world SOC practice, where defenders prioritize signal-over-noise and tune telemetry to detect tactics such as Living-Off-the-Land (LOTL), persistence, and privilege escalation.

‚úÖ Results
Stage	Outcome
Sysmon Logging	Full visibility of encoded command-line, process parent, integrity level, and hashes.
Splunk Ingestion	Event correctly indexed in Splunk with expected sourcetype and searchability.
Detection Confirmation	Validated using local PowerShell queries and Splunk searches.

üìå Strategic Value
This project shows how curated telemetry tuning enhances visibility without overwhelming analysts. It reflects enterprise SOC practices where raw audit verbosity is replaced by structured signal, enabling detection of:

Obfuscated execution

LOLBins and native tool abuse

Process chains supporting attack narratives

Persistence attempts via scheduled tasks

Reconnaissance and lateral movement indicators
